Perform a comprehensive security audit of my codebase

<code_to_audit>
[Paste authentication, authorization, data handling, API endpoints]
</code_to_audit>

<application_context>
<type>[Web app/API/Mobile backend/etc.]</type>
<sensitive_data>[What user data do you handle?]</sensitive_data>
<compliance_requirements>[GDPR/HIPAA/PCI-DSS/etc.]</compliance_requirements>
<current_security_measures>[What you already have: JWT, HTTPS, rate limiting, etc.]</current_security_measures>
</application_context>

<audit_checklist>
1. Authentication vulnerabilities (weak passwords, session management)
2. Authorization flaws (privilege escalation, IDOR)
3. Input validation (SQL injection, XSS, command injection)
4. Data exposure (sensitive data in logs, responses, errors)
5. Cryptography issues (weak algorithms, key management)
6. API security (rate limiting, CORS, authentication bypass)
7. Dependency vulnerabilities (outdated packages)
8. Configuration issues (debug mode, exposed endpoints)
</audit_checklist>

<output_format>
For each vulnerability found:
- Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- Location: [Exact file and line]
- Exploit scenario: [How an attacker would abuse this]
- Fix: [Exact code change needed]
- Prevention: [How to avoid this pattern in future]
</output_format>

<priorities>
Focus on vulnerabilities that could lead to:
1. Data breaches
2. Account takeovers
3. Financial loss
4. Compliance violations
</priorities>
