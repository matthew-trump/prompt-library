<test_requirements>
1. Unit tests (test each function in isolation)
2. Integration tests (test components working together)
3. Edge cases (null, empty, extreme values)
4. Error cases (what happens when things go wrong)
5. Performance tests (if relevant - e.g., large datasets)
</test_requirements>

<test_quality_criteria>
- Each test should have ONE clear purpose
- Test names should read like documentation
- Use arrange-act-assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies properly
- Tests should be deterministic (no random values, no timing issues)
- Include both positive and negative test cases
</test_quality_criteria>

<deliverables>
1. Complete test file(s) with imports and setup
2. Test descriptions explaining WHAT each test validates
3. Coverage report estimate (% of code paths tested)
4. Instructions for running the tests
5. Recommendations for CI/CD integration
</deliverables>

<special_focus>
Pay extra attention to:
- Boundary conditions
- Concurrency issues (if applicable)
- Data validation logic
- Business rule edge cases
