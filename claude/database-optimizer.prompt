Optimize my database queries and schema for production performance
</database_optimization>

<current_situation>
<schema>
[Paste your database schema - tables, columns, relationships]
</schema>

<problematic_queries>
[Paste the slow queries with EXPLAIN ANALYZE output if available]
</problematic_queries>

<performance_metrics>
- Current query time: [time]
- Expected query time: [target]
- Query frequency: [calls per second]
- Data volume: [rows in relevant tables]
</performance_metrics>
</current_situation>

<optimization_scope>
1. Index recommendations (what's missing, what's unused)
2. Query rewrites (more efficient SQL)
3. Schema improvements (normalization, denormalization decisions)
4. Caching strategies (what to cache, where, for how long)
5. Partitioning recommendations (if applicable)
</optimization_scope>

<analysis_requirements>
- Explain the root cause of slowness
- Show the performance impact of each change
- Consider write vs read trade-offs
- Account for data growth over next 2 years
</analysis_requirements>

<deliverables>
1. Prioritized list of changes (biggest impact first)
2. Migration scripts (ALTER TABLE statements)
3. Before/after query plans
4. Estimated performance improvements
</deliverables>
